Welcome to the new blog
=======================

Another decade, another blog engine. This time I'm trying to scratch a
different kind of itch: I want to write down documentation-style
articles as much as I want to jibber-jabber about "news".

What I *really* wanted was Sphinx, which I have grown to love over the
years as a way to organize a big pile of interlinked stuff, along with
snippets of working code. So I'm using Ablog, a blog engine for Sphinx
which includes facilities for pushing to GitHub Pages.r
