About
=====

I am the PyCharm and WebStorm Developer Advocate at JetBrains and a partner with
Chris McDonough and Tres Seaver at Agendaless Consulting. Before that,
I was a co-founder with Zope Corporation, taking the first open source
application server through $14M of funding.

I helped bootstrapped both the PSF and the Python Software Foundation.
Before that, I was an officer in the US Navy, starting www.navy.mil in
1993.
