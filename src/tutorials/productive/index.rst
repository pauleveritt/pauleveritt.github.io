Productive Python with PyCharm
==============================

Modern Python development has become quite sophisticated, with large
projects using many dependencies and multiple programming technologies.
Some Python developers prefer an integrated development environment (IDE).
PyCharm provides a powerful, mature IDE for Python and other technologies
such as web development.

But PyCharm has a ton of features, and getting started with them can be
daunting. Wouldn't it be great to learn by writing a Python application,
using the most PyCharmic techniques possible?

Here is that tutorial. In it, we construct a Flask application, in
PyCharm, using a number of PyCharm features.
