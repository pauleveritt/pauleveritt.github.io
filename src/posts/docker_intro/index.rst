=======================
Using Docker in PyCharm
=======================

Modern development workflows emphasize isolation and reproducability
in development and production. `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`_ and
its platform approach to containers has become very popular. With
PyCharm Professional Edition 5,
`Docker is now supported <http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2015/10/announcing-pycharm-5-eap-143-165-docker-integration/>`_
as a remote interpreter.

Let's take a look at PyCharm's Docker integration in action.

Summary
=======

- Get a Django-oriented Docker image pulled locally

- Make a sample Django project

- Create a Docker interpeter to run it

- The Django run configuration makes a new container on start and
  removes it on stop

Overview
========

In Python, when you run an application -- a Django site, a database
script, etc. -- you are running it in an environment. Python has some
tools to manage the environment and make it reproducible, such as
virtual environments, pip ``requirements.txt`` files, and ``setup.py``
dependencies. But what about the non-Python parts of application?

Containers are one solution to this. In Docker, a container is an
isolated universe with software, running inside your computer. They are
fast and easy to create, start, stop, and destroy. This is ideal, not
just for development, but for deployment as well.

PyCharm 5 provides the beginning of a series of steps towards "develop
with pleasure" using containers and Docker. Namely, PyCharm 5 supports
project interpreters that are executed in a Docker container.

Preparation
===========

First, make sure ``docker`` and ``docker-machine`` are setup in your
environment. The Docker installation is painless and the
`website docs <https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/>`_
are quite friendly. You'll need a Docker "host" virtual machine setup
and running, including on Linux. On Windows and OS X, installing the
Docker Toolbox is effortless.

Next, we have to decide what software we want in our containers. In
Docker, containers are built using "images": collections of
pre-installed software plus configuration that is called during
container creation. Unlike other interpreters in PyCharm, you don't
visit the ``Project Interpreter`` preferences to add Python packages.
All dependencies need to be baked into the Docker image you choose.

This blog post is based on the ``minimum/docker-django-mysite`` Docker
image, which includes enough Python/Django software to run the
PyCharm-generated Django starter project. You can fetch that onto your
system with this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker pull minimum/docker-django-mysite

Once that Docker image is locally available *and* the Docker "host" is
running and knows about it, PyCharm can make Docker interpreters for
your project, as containers based on that image.

Alternatively, you can skip this step and later pull in the image while
creating the Docker-based remote interpreter by simply typing in
the image name during creation.

.. note::

    You have the option of making your own image as well, using a
    ``Dockerfile``. Once you make the image, you can tell PyCharm to
    make Docker interpreters based on it.

Create Django Project
=====================

Let's make a Django project, then make a Docker interpreter for it. In
PyCharm, choose ``File -> New Project``, click on ``Django``, and
follow the normal process for making a Django project.

During project creation, you'll have to use a local interpreter. If you
try to make a Docker interpreter, PyCharm will give a warning saying
you can only use a local interpreter.

The result of this step is a directory on your local computer with
sample Django code and a Django-specific PyCharm Run Configuration.

Make PyCharm Docker Interpreter
===============================

On to the important part. We need to define a "remote interpreter" that
runs in a PyCharm Docker container.

First, go to ``Preferences -> Project Interpreter`` and click on the
gear to the right of ``Project Interpreter`` near the top. In the
``Configure Remote Python Interpreter`` dialog, click the ``Docker``
button. You should see the following:

Click the menu dropdown for ``Machine Name``. It will likely have one
entry named ``default``. Choose that, and you will see the following:

.. image:: screenshots/docker_interpreter.png

Choosing ``default`` gives PyCharm a way to find the Docker daemon, which
can let PyCharm know which images are available locally. Hence the
dropdown for ``Images``. Click on the dropdown and choose
``minimum/docker-django-mysite:latest`` as the image, then click ``Ok``.

You now have a Docker container that will be used as your project
interpreter. PyCharm features like autocompletion, code inspections,
and checks will be driven by this interpreter.

Run Django
==========

Now that we have a Docker container for our project interpreter, let's
use our Django-flavored Run Configuration to run it. Just to be safe,
edit the run configuration to make sure it is using the Docker-oriented
interpreter.

What does PyCharm do when it runs this configuration:

#. First, it creates and starts a new container based on the image we
   named when creating the project interpreter.

#. This container mounts your project directory into the container at
   ``/opt/project`` in the container. *Note: On Linux, you currently
   have to perform this volume mapping manually.*

#. This container also mounts volumes needed for PyCharm to do its
   work: Python skeletons and Python library sources.

#. It then executes the run configuration's Python command.

If you are running PyCharm 5.0.2 or older, there is one fix you need to
do:

- Run -> Edit Configurations and select the PyCharm-generated Djano run
  configuration

- In the ``Host`` field, enter ``0.0.0.0``

When you click the "Run" button, Django will be started. Yay, we are
running a container! In fact, we can go on to test running, debugging,
code coverage, profiling, and all the other ways to run a
configuration. But first, let's click the link in the console to open
the Django site in our browser:

.. image:: screenshots/django_admin.png

You can confirm this using the following Docker commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker ps -l

This shows the most recently-run container. As you can see, our
``minimum/docker-django-mysite``-based container is currently running.

Likewise, when you click the "Stop" button in PyCharm to stop the
running Django configuration, PyCharm not only stops Django, but it
also stops the Docker container. In fact, it deletes the container.
Each time you run, PyCharm creates a new Docker container and starts it.

You can confirm this. After re-starting the Django run configuration,
type:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker ps -l

The value in the ``CONTAINER ID`` column, as well as the ``NAMES``
value, is different from the previous values we got from running
``docker ps -l``.

Current Limitations
===================

Docker integration in PyCharm is already useful, but is still only a
start. Much more is being done for future releases. For example:

- *Docker Compose*. This is a big item and a frequently-requested
  feature. The discussion is happening in a
  `YouTrack ticket <https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-17573>`_
  in the PyCharm ticket system and work is already being scheduled.

- *Linux mounts*. As noted in the PyCharm online help, on Linux, you have
  to mount your project directory manually via VirtualBox. This issue
  is obviated by work on the next point.

- *Customizing the container*. Docker lets you pass arguments when
  creating/running a container. These arguments include volumes to mount
  and ports to forward. PyCharm doesn't currently let you customize
  this in the run configuration, but this is being worked on.

- *Only Django for web ports*. If you want a container with HTTP (or
  any other) ports available, the Django run configuration is the only
  one, and that is only for HTTP. Other run configurations (Flask,
  Pyramid, etc.) won't forward any ports. Nor will attaching to a
  database, or orchestrating multi-container apps (unless your
  Dockerfile forwards the ports.) This is really just emphasizing the
  previous point, and as said there, help is on its way.

Conclusion
==========

With this release we've shown the beginnings of what we can do with
Docker integration, and the results are promising. Docker has the
potential to be a first-class part of PyCharm's "Develop With Pleasure"
