Project and Editor UI
=====================

PyCharm. It's...big. Lots of windows, buttons, menus. What's that UI all
about?

In this section we go over the major parts of the UI -- the menus, toolbar,
tool windows, editor, etc. -- in the course of some development tasks.

.. note::

    The starting point for this section is the end of the :doc:`../setup`
    section.
