Polyglot Python with PyCharm
============================

.. note::

    This series is a work-in-progress.

If you're a long-time Python web developer, you are used to web
technologies: HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript. But modern frontend
web development might seem alien and un-Pythonic.

If so, this series of articles is aimed at you. These frontend ideas
are important, but you need a Python guide through the thicket. You
also need a tool that can support your Python *and* frontend development.
PyCharm, with the foundation it shares with WebStorm, is uniquely
suited for this.

In this series we will introduce ideas and packages in isolation,
with hands-on code, screenshots, and more. Each article's code is
`in GitHub
<https://github.com/pauleveritt/pauleveritt.github.io>`_. You can
comment on the articles using Disqus and file bug reportes in the
`issue tracker
<https://github.com/pauleveritt/pauleveritt.github.io/issues>`_.
