About This Tutorial
===================

*Productive Python with PyCharm* is intended as a 2.5 hour tutorial,
either self-paced or delivered by an instructor. The focus is on hands-on
learning, with enough support to avoid frustrations.

Prerequisites
=============

- Basic knowledge of Python and some exposure to the web

- Installation of Python 3.5.1 or later

- Installation of PyCharm Professional (either 30 day evaluation or
  licensed version)

- A web browser

- Recent version of git

*Note: The examples are targeted at OS X, but everything works fine in
Windows or Linux.*

Objectives
==========

- Introduce Python developers to the concept of a Python IDE

- Show the major PyCharm features in the context of writing an application

- Provide key productivity features, where PyCharm speeds development

- Cover web development with PyCharm’s HTML/CSS/JS IDE capabilities

- This tutorial is *not* a Flask nor SQLAlchemy tutorial...those are
  only used for visual illustration

Tutorial Organization
=====================

The tutorial is organized into sections which group the kinds of PyCharm
features being introduced. Within each section are tasks, where we
develop part of our application, using described PyCharm features.

Each of these tasks is presented as documentation, with sample code
in the page but also in a standalone directory in a repository. If
you ever get behind, or frustrated, you can use this code to teleport
yourself to a good working state.

When delivered in person, each task in a section will be demonstrated
first by the instructor. Later, we might bridge that gap for self-paced
by including a screencast for each
